MENACHERY-ERINJERY FAMILY

The Menacherys or Menasserys - in local Malayalam, form a large so-called 'clan', which has its extended and individual families spread out in the whole of erstwhile Cochin State, and today you may find them in different parts of Kerala, other States of India and even in different continents. The word 'clan' is used because different subgroups of  Menacherys share the same name or have some shared interests or characteristics. 
One comes across clusters of Menacherys in Njarakkal, Parur, Angamaly, Karimalur, Chalakkudy, Mukkattukara, Ollur, Cherpu and Chiyyaram. Often, a sub-group is identified by a second name, like Menachery-Erinjery, Menachery-Irumpen and Menachery-Myliparamban. 
The sub-groups of Ollur, Cherpu and Chiyyaram, identified as Menachery-Erinjery, were once under the Pazhuvil parish till the establishment of parish churches in Ollur, Cherpu and much later in Chiyyaram. The connections of these sub-groups with the Kattur-Pazhuvil coastal belt on the banks of Kol Lands deserve further investigation, though their ancestors always mentioned these places. The claims of the interrelationship with the Mukkatukara sub-group also need a historical enquiry. Do they have anything to do with the Erijery Angadi in Thrissur, starting from the Marthamariam Church, perhaps established by Shakthan Thampuran? Can we trace their roots to the 'Pudumenassery' family, which accepted the faith from the Apostle in Parur or Palayur as the tradition claims? 
The ancestors and elders of the family always speak about the family's connection with the Apostle Thomas. Specific investigations have revealed that a Menassery hamlet exists just 12 km from Kokkamangalam, where the Apostle preached the Gospel, added 1600 faithful to the folk, and planted a Cross; the Cross thrown away by the miscreants to the Vembanad Wetland is now in Pallipuram church (Ramban Pattu). There is a church in the name of the Apostle in Kokkamangalam. There is still a Menassery Temple near the hamlet, as well. 
The Menacherys spread out from Njarakkal near Menassery and Pallipuram to the Cherpu-Ollur-Chiyyaram belt close to the coast on the banks of Vembanad-Kol Wetland, providing inland navigation. They had a chain of eminent Malpans and priests. In the nineteenth century, three brothers from their family together joined the Order of Discalced Carmelites (OCD) in Vazhakkulam. 
This portal focuses on the Menachery Erinjerys of Ollur, Cherpu and Chiyyaram; the family tree of these three sub-groups is available now.
